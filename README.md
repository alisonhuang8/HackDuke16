# HackDuke

At Duke, food points are used to purchase meals from merchants on the system. In many cases, students end up with leftover food points
at the end of the semester. Every semester, students' food points get reset so many food points go to waste unnecessarily. This web app
helps students easily donate a portion of their food points to a charity of their choice every time they swipe their card.
